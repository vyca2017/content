# Auth

Graphcool comes with **powerful authentication and authorization out-of-the-box**.

You can choose between a wide range of option to enable  [user authentication](!alias-geekae9gah) for your project. [Authentication tokens](!alias-eip7ahqu5o) are used to authenticate users as well as server-side calls to your API.

With the [authorization system](!alias-iegoo0heez), it's easy to create even [powerful permission rules](!alias-iox3aqu0ee) that seamlessly integrate with authentication.
