# Making requests to the Simple API

To actually send a request to the Simple API, you first need to copy the [endpoint](!alias-uh8shohxie#client-api-endpoints) URL assigned to your project which looks like this:

`https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__`


The Simple API is supposed to be consumed by GraphQL clients such as [Apollo Client](#apollo-client), or [lokka](#lokka) and can be also consumed with [plain HTTP requests](#curl).

## Apollo Client

### Setup

To set up the client with your endpoint:

```javascript
import ApolloClient, { createNetworkInterface } from 'apollo-client'

const client = new ApolloClient({
  networkInterface: createNetworkInterface({ uri: 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__' }),
})
```

Now you can use Apollo to do queries and mutations. If you are unsure about the setup, check our Instagram example app using Apollo in [React](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-apollo-instagram-example) or [Angular 2](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/angular-apollo-instagram-example). Find more information in the official [documentation](http://dev.apollodata.com/).

## lokka

### Setup

To set up the client with your endpoint:

```javascript
const Lokka = require('lokka').Lokka;
const Transport = require('lokka-transport-http').Transport;

const client = new Lokka({
  transport: new Transport('https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__')
});
```

Now you can use lokka to do queries and mutations. If you are unsure about the setup, check our [Todo example app using lokka](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-lokka-todo-example). Find more information in the official  [documentation](https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka/blob/master/README.md).

## curl

You can also communicate with the Simple API by using plain HTTP POST requests. For example, to query `allUsers`, do a POST request to your endpoint `https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__`. With `curl` you could do:

```
curl 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-binary '{"query":"query {allUsers {id name}}"}' --compressed
```
