# CLI

You can use the Graphcool CLI to manage your Graphcool projects and run schema migrations.

## Getting Started

* Install the `graphcool` command-line tool and create a new project:

```sh
npm install -g graphcool
graphcool init
```

This creates a new Graphcool project and a corresponding [`project.graphcool` file](!alias-ow2yei7mew).
Now you can explore the [available commands](!alias-tha5feef7i) to tackle common workflows.
